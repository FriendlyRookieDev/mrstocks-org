<h2>Why is the Forex Market Appealing to a Beginner Investor?</h2>
<p>The forex market has a low barrier to entry and anyone can start investing with a small-dollar initial deposit. Operating 24 hours a day, unlike other global markets, allows part-time traders and very active traders to make trades at any time rather than limiting their trades to business hours.</p>
<p>Forex traders also can set their stop-loss and exit price prior to making any trades. This allows you to mitigate your risk without having to constantly check your investments. A top forex broker will be able to point you in the right direction with high-quality research tools and forex and CFD know-how that U.S clients and a range of markets can take heed of.</p>
<p>Before choosing the best forex broker for you, you&#8217;ll need to understand how CFDs work, know the difference between forex and CFD and understand the qualities of the best forex brokers.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Forex Broker The Best Forex Broker?</h2>
<p>While some of what makes the best forex broker will be subjective there are a few aspects that are standard that you need to verify before handing your money over.</p>
<h3>Are They Regulated?</h3>
<p>Any broker you&#8217;re considering working with should be regulated by at least one regulatory authority. No regulation means a risky broker. The best forex broker is regulated by more than one authority.</p>
<h3>Look for Account Segregation</h3>
<p>Every broker will claim that your forex trading money is safe with them this is what makes the search for the best forex broker tricky. Confirming their claims takes some digging. A great way to figure out if the broker has your best interests in mind is to see how they manage accounts.</p>
<p>If they offer segregated accounts then you will be able to place your funds in an account the broker has no access to. If they require you to put all your money in one place and the broker has access to the entire amount it should send off some red flags.</p>
<p>If the broker you&#8217;re considering cannot offer some sort of funds safety guarantee then you should pass on working with them for your forex investments. The best forex broker will guarantee the safety of your funds.</p>
<h3>What Kind of Commissions Are They Charging?</h3>
<p>Depending on the broker, you&#8217;ll pay a different commission structure on each trade. Some offer $0 commissions and others take a percentage of your profits in exchange for execution of your forex trading. It&#8217;s a good practice to understand the broker&#8217;s commission structure before making your initial deposit.</p>
<p>When there is already high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage you&#8217;ll want to make sure you aren&#8217;t losing your shirt on commissions too. Somewhere between 74-89% of retail investor accounts can lose rapidly due to leverage so you want to pay attention to every fee and commission.</p>
<h2>The Top 5 Things to Know Before You Choose Your Forex Broker for Your Investments</h2>
<p>Here are the things you need to know about forex trading and forex trading platforms before choosing a forex broker.</p>
<h3>What Type of Investor Are You?</h3>
<p>Before you begin your search for the perfect forex broker you need to do some self-analysis. What type of investor do you want to be? Let&#8217;s go over the three types of investors so you know what will be best for your situation.</p>
<h4>The Day Trader</h4>
<p>When beginners think of being a trader this is the most common vision they experience. A day trader is a person who buys into different currency pairs (EUR USD for example) at the beginning of a trading day and 90% of the time they&#8217;ll sell off one or more of their currency pairs sometime before the end of the trading day.</p>
<p>They also trade high volumes of currency pairs at a time to make the most amount of profit possible. Day traders depend on more volatile currency pairs, technical trading patterns, and quality trading platforms to plan and make their trades. This results in very high profits but also a high risk of losing money.</p>
<p>These traders scan the trading platforms for short term opportunities to jump on at the moment, get their money quickly, and get out. The last thing they want is to enter into a currency pair on a trading platform and have their investor accounts lose money. When retail investor accounts lose money it makes day trading seem less appealing. After all the goal is not to lose money when trading it&#8217;s to make money. If you lose money when trading you have to adjust your trading style and research.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not interested in the highest risk options consider some of the more stable trading styles.</p>
<h4>The Swing Trader</h4>
<p>The swing trader is flexible in the amount of time they hold their positions. While they sometimes trade within hours of purchase, especially if their accounts lose money all of a sudden. this same investor may hold for days or even weeks at a time in certain investments. In others, they may maintain just the account minimum to stay active.</p>
<p>Timing becomes the most important aspect of the swing traders&#8217; strategy. Calculating probabilities of when the most profit is possible. Savvy swing trades take place in more liquid currency pairs like the EUR USD pair. Great forex brokers offer customer service to help with this research and analyzing the trading platform so you can make an educated decision.</p>
<p>Most of the best forex brokers also won&#8217;t allow your account to dip below zero or the account minimum.</p>
<h4>The Position Trader</h4>
<p>This professional is focused on long-term strategy over short-term wins. The position trader holds for days, weeks, months, even years before trading a position. They do a lot of research using government decisions, policy changes, and other legislation and regulation with long-term effects. Then they make the best overall decision and stay the course.</p>
<p>They also look at G7 and emerging markets for the best overall long-term plays and better probabilities over the span of time.</p>
<h3>Is the Broker You&#8217;re Considering Regulated?</h3>
<p>You should never deal with a broker that isn&#8217;t regulated. Especially as a beginner, using an unregulated broker puts your finances at higher risk.</p>
<p>Make sure to check the regulation of any broker you&#8217;re considering. Regulations were a big consideration for us when choosing the best overall forex broker, along with the level of customer service they provide, and the funding and withdrawal procedures of the brokerage.</p>
<h3>How Much Do You Have to Fund Your Margin Account?</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re starting forex trading your initial account will be a margin account. This allows a new trader to play in the markets as if they had a lot more money invested with a small initial deposit. The margin depends on the broker you choose.</p>
<p>Some require low initial deposits, as low as $100. Then they provide you with a specific percentage of margin. So if you have a 50:1 margin that means you can trade as if you have $5000 with only $100 in the account.</p>
<p>Why do they do this? Currencies, unlike typical stocks, have very small incremental changes. They also rarely go to 0. So in order to see any tangible profit, you need to be playing with much larger sums of money.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working on limited funds you&#8217;ll need to consider the minimum deposit to your margin account before choosing your broker. While some offer low entry others require higher initial deposits, sometimes in the thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3>What Are the Broker&#8217;s Funding and Withdrawal Procedures?</h3>
<p>Depending on the broker you choose you could have a long waiting period before you can start trading. This is usually associated with check or wire transfers. Sometimes you&#8217;ll have access to the cash immediately.</p>
<p>Other brokers may also charge significant fees to withdraw funds from the account. These are both things to consider before settling on the <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_forex.html">best forex broker for you free of fraud</a>.</p>
<h3>Review the Broker&#8217;s Trade Execution Procedures so You&#8217;re Getting the Best Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Most brokers won&#8217;t charge any trade execution fees. Some may have trade execution procedures that can cause a conflict of interest. Most reputable brokers will have information about their trade execution processes available to review on their website before you decide to choose them.</p>
<p>Specifically, check to see if the broker is using a dealer desk to execute the trade or communicating directly with the interbank system themselves.</p>
<p>Most online broker systems and traders will be able to give you a traders demo account to practice with before you jump into the real online broker traders game. This web-based account shows how well the pairs you bet would do with real money. Beginner traders get a leg up if they want to trade forex because most traders in other markets don&#8217;t get a practice account if they want to trade.</p>
<h2>Other Considerations Before We Get to the Top 10</h2>
<p>Before we get into the meat of the matter we want to clear up a couple more questions that are commonly asked by traders in the search for a forex broker.</p>
<h3>What is the Difference Between Forex Trading and High-Frequency Forex Trading?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll hear high-frequency mentioned a lot in the forex world. This refers to traders that participate in multiple deals a day or even potentially utilize a program to do the trades for them, like automatic traders. They don&#8217;t hold their positions and they use many different charts to create their trades.</p>
<p>The benefit of high-frequency traders is that they get their returns right away. The drawback is the greater risk and lower overall profits associated with high-frequency trading CFDs and FX. While a longer play doing around 4-5 trades a month can average 400 pips per trade, high-frequency will garner 20-40 pips per trade and have a much higher probability of losses. Why? High=frequency traders are subject to overconfidence and a higher risk of burnout and seeing opportunities that don&#8217;t actually make sense.</p>
<p>Taking your time and always looking at charts with fresh eyes is beneficial because you see legitimate opportunities more clearly.</p>
<h3>What is the Biggest Forex Broker?</h3>
<p>Plus500, based out of London, is the biggest forex broker in the world and one that has been around a while since 2008. They are listed on the stock exchange and are considered a safe and reputable forex broker. They offer both desktop and mobile trading.</p>
<h3>Is SuperForex a Good Broker?</h3>
<p>You may be tempted to work with SuperForex. But, they are not a reputable or safe forex broker. They are based out of Belize and are not subject to strict regulation. Belize is a major offshore financial hub because they require very little to maintain accounts there. They aren&#8217;t publicly traded and a lot of U.S clients don&#8217;t use them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a good idea to work with offshore brokerages because your money won&#8217;t be as safe as with a fully regulated forex brokerage. Especially if you&#8217;re looking at trading common currency pairs like EUR USD there is no reason to take the high risk of working with an unregulated broker. You already take the high-risk route in a market like forex without losing money rapidly due to legal and unregulated circumstances.</p>
<p>Remember that FX, foreign exchange investments, are complex instruments and come with high risks. You want everything to mitigate the risk of these complex instruments and come at the search with your eyes wide open.</p>
<h3>Which Order Entry Types Do They Offer?</h3>
<p>Know which types of orders you&#8217;ll want to make and then make sure the broker offers those options.</p>
<p>Reputable top forex brokers will be able to get you any order you want but some may be more limited than others. Do your research, especially as a beginner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to keep in mind that trading CFDs and FX, the foreign exchange, are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly. Choosing a quality broker that offers forex pairs with good spreads and a high level of customer service is your best bet at avoiding the downfall.</p>
