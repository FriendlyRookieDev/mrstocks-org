                        <h1>IBKR Interactive Brokers Review</h1>
                        <p>From a broker comparison you will find in the best case the test winner and the top broker that offers its investors the most favorable conditions and the most diverse trading instruments possible. In this article, we want to look at the Interactive Brokers experience. This is one of the largest online brokers that currently exist on the market for domestic and international trading. Accordingly, you can access a wide range of trading instruments. This includes ETFs, futures as well as stocks and CFDs, commodities and currencies as well as options. With this following guide, we would like to help you get started with Interactive Brokers and answer the most frequently asked questions.</p>
<h2>Who is Interactive Brokers?</h2>
<p>Interactive Brokers is abbreviated as IB. The predecessor of this online broker is Timber Hill. It is an American stock broker founded by Thomas Peterffy in 1977. Today it remains to say that Timber Hill was one of the first brokers to work on the American Stock Exchange market and the trading floor with the portable computers. The associated GmbH in Germany was founded in 1990. At that time, the main focus was on electronic trading with regard to the German Futures Exchange, or DTB for short. This became Eurex a little later. In 1993, Timber Hill and Interactive Brokers merged to form Trader Workstation &#8211; TWS.</p>
<p>Already in 1997, the volume of equity derivatives listed on the stock exchange at Timber Hill online included 5% worldwide. In total, the broker came up with 15,000 transactions. A respectable selection, considering that the digital market was still in its infancy at that time. Already in 2000, an average of 6% of the global volume was traded via this network. In 2001, Timber Hill GmbH changed its name to Interactive Brokers Group LLC.</p>
<p>In 2003, the company was already executing 12,000 of the world&#8217;s listed index and stock transactions. In 2007 the company went public. Per share, Interactive Brokers issued $30.01. Today, the company is listed on the NASDAQ with the abbreviation IBKR.Anyone who is extensively involved in securities trading and wants to learn more about the shares and international trading, can not get past the Interactive Brokers.</p>

<h3>Top brokers in price and revenue worldwide</h3>
<p>Time and again Interactive Brokers top the ranking for the cheapest brokers, the last time the broker climbed the podium in 2009 in terms of the cheapest brokers. This was the fifth time in a row. In 2009, the provider also launched its trading app iTWS, which was available for the iPhone. In the statistics, it came out that the prices keep improving when it comes to the US stocks and the options. Whereas the THG statistics is an independent analysis, which in turn is carried out by the company IHS Market.</p>
<p>In 2011 Interactive Brokers was selected among the largest US online brokers when it comes to the average yield of transactions per day. In technical terminology, we are talking about the so-called Daily Average Revenue Trades. For investors, it is precisely these revenues that play a decisive role. That with the most favorable online broker, which on the trading platform only small yields are made. Basically, investors want to get the maximum out of their assets with an online broker. According to relevant Interactive Brokers experience, this is easily possible with this provider.</p>
<p>Since 2011, there has been a new user interface on the Trader Workstation with the TWS Mosaic interface. In 2017, the broker received the award for the fifth time as the best online broker in trade magazines such as Barrons. Worldwide, more than 1400 employees work on the TWS Mosaic interface &#8211; every day, investors execute over 1 million transactions with this online broker. Thus, this provider alone has an equity capital of a considerable 5 billion US dollars. These are enormous values, with which almost no German online broker and certainly no Neo Broker can keep up. However, first and foremost, this provider is all about stability, years of experience and the wide range of products that traders benefit from.</p>
<p>This company is known for its very conservative approach and business policy. For this reason, Interactive Brokers has also not been directly affected by the financial crisis, making significant losses. For years, this company has been operating consistently and profitably, regardless of the political and economic movements on the world stage. This is remarkable and today it ensures that more and more users find their way to Trader Workstation.</p>
<p>What markets can be traded at Interactive Brokers?</p>
<p>One of the direct benefits is the market access to options, forex, futures and stocks as well as the fixed income securities, CFDs and ETFs. All this is possible only with an account at Interactive Brokers. In turn, the broker allows its traders to trade with over 125 international exchanges, spread across 31 countries. The most popular exchanges include Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. Interactive Brokers brings all these linking points together in the Trader Workstation.</p>
<p>Additionally, traders can trade ETFs in 26 countries. Commodities, futures and options are offered in 35 market centers worldwide. More than 15 trading options are available to the trader. In addition, the complex financial instruments such as CFDs are applicable to all available and common stocks, currencies and indices. Currently, the current offer in this area includes 7,250 stocks. With regard to Forex trading, Interactive Brokers scores with 100 currency pairs.</p>
<h2>Security: How is Interactive Brokers regulated?</h2>
<p>In fact, there is no minimum deposit at this online broker. You can get in from very low stakes, which should appeal to private investors in particular. At the same time, Interactive Brokers never puts the safety of its investors at risk. The Financial Conduct Authority is entrusted with the regulation and supervision of Interactive Brokers. Due to the legal and worldwide supervision, the common risks can be avoided. In this way, Interactive Brokers performs well in the test, as does Trader Workstation.</p>
<p>Attention: Currently there is no legally regulated deposit insurance. This is not because Interactive Brokers does not care about the safety of their investors&#8217; deposits from Europe. It is a certified company from the USA, which does not fall under the legislation of Europe. According to it, all the accounts are managed as so-called segregated accounts. Interactive Brokers stores its own assets separately from the investors&#8217; assets, thus providing massive security.</p>
<p>In addition to these segregated accounts between Interactive Brokers and equity &#8211; the US Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) steps in if the very unlikely event occurs and IB goes bust. All other non-U.S. territory positions and cash positions can be protected and hedged again through a U.K. company. Sudeck, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), protects the assets of 50,000 British pounds.</p>
<h3>How can I register a demo account with Interactive Brokers?</h3>
<p>It is very easy on the home page to open a demo account without any complications. This can be done directly from a menu bar at the top of the screen in the right corner. You can recognize the demo account by the inscription Free Demo. Next to it is the Open account button. This step should be taken later, when you are satisfied with the offer and trading and want to deposit your own money into the account.</p>
<p>Based on the Interactive Brokers test, the account opening process is straightforward and very fast online. For this, you need to have a few important information ready to completely fill out your personal account starting from the Interactive Brokers experience. This includes the name with the appropriate</p>
<p>proof of identity,<br>
the address,<br>
the place of residence,<br>
the country of birth and<br>
the date of birth and<br>
citizenship.</p>
<p>Where are you resident for tax purposes? In addition to this, Interactive Brokers asks for your name and address from your employer and would like to receive information about your personal income and five assets. What are your securities trading experience and investment goals? The online brokers are required to put investors through their paces. This is to avoid the risk of a beginner simply putting a lot of money without knowing about each financial instrument, its features and risks.</p>
<h3>The conditions at Interactive Brokers</h3>
<p>At Interactive Brokers, investors are offered tight spreads, which are accompanied by strengthened liquidity and very good conditions. This applies, for example, to foreign exchange trading.

<p>ETFs,<br>
warrants,<br>

stocks.</p>
<p>There are two different commission models at Interactive Brokers, such as the tiered model, where fees decrease as trading volume increases. Alternatively, Interactive Brokers allows investors to calculate and set a fixed price commission for each financial product. Alternatively, there is a percentage trade value that is recalculated depending on the trade value.

<h2>How much does it cost to trade through Interactive Brokers?</h2>
<p>You can trade the US stocks from $0.05 per share. The mini malst of the fee is one US dollar. The fees for German stocks are 0.1% calculated on the transaction volume. Interactive Brokers charges a minimum fee of four euros per order and is therefore not the cheapest online broker in a direct comparison. The commissions for the options depend on the volume of the contract at Interactive Brokers. You can access the German stock options with this US online broker for a fee of 1.10 euros per contract. For example, Interactive Brokers offers the safe DAX, which comes with a commission of 1.70 euros.</p>
<p>The cost of the futures options or the US futures ranks at around $0.85, which is per contract. For the German futures, you pay Interactive Brokers a fee of two euros per contract. The commissions that accrue when trading forex through this broker are again dependent on the amount traded each month. It is best to call up the current price-performance list directly from Interactive Brokers. In the Interactive Brokers test, the provider scores with transparency and a clear listing of the costs and fees that investors have to pay plus if you work with one of the market leaders.</p>
<p>Index CFDs cost from 0.005% at Interactive Brokers, which in turn accrue per execution. If the view goes to the European shares and CFDs, the commissions amount to 0.02% or else to 0.05%, which again applies to each execution of the broker. This is also true for CFD trading, here the fees you pay to Interactive Brokers are the same. If you hold the CFD positions beyond the close of the market, you will have to pay interest for each day. It is a blended rate that is payable depending on the amounts.</p>
<h2>Interactive Brokers leverage and margin requirements.</h2>
<p>There is a European Securities and Markets Authority since August 1, 2018, which are referred to as ESMA. This authority specifies so-called thresholds. In return, Interactive Brokers commits to liquidate these open positions and thus provide qualified capital. In addition, Interactive Brokers determines chief positions and margin requirements. This is the amount of collateral that an investor must bring to speculate with a certain capital and dispose of his money on the exchange.</p>
<p>In August 1, 2018, there are going out from Europe and the Securities and Markets Authority thresholds. These refer to the minimum inclusions. In this regard, Interactive Brokers undertakes to liquidate all open positions. This is the case whenever the qualifying capital of the CFD account falls below the 50% mark. What is meant is the margin requirement that applies to all CFD positions. In addition, there are the in-house requirements of Interactive Brokers from the UK. These go back to the historical volatility of the underlying assets as well as individual influencing factors. These are the main requirements that are attached to the trade. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether trading is done in Euros or USD. The margin requirements for all equity CFDs are set at 20% with regard to retail clients. The margin requirement also applies in this area. The minimum of the large in indices is 5%. Otherwise, the minimum requirements are 10%.</p>
<p>In addition, there are further margin requirements at Interactive Brokers Group as far as the major forex pairs are concerned. This is set at 3.33%. You can trade the smaller currency pairs starting from a margin of 5%. In addition, there are so-called exotic currency pairs at Interactive Brokers UK, which in turn oscillate between 10 and 15%.</p>
<p>For the DAX futures, for example, the margin requirements come to €13,491 and with regard to the over night values to €26,983. However, these values can also be adjusted depending on volatility. Thus, they can be higher depending on the daily level. For the US Dollar/Euro, the spread at the broker Interactive Brokers is 0.01 Pip. As for the competition, Interactive Brokers U.K. Limited can not be faulted in terms of service. Thus, as a customer, you do not pay a cent for the deposit and services.

<h2>Does Interactive Brokers automatically deduct the final withholding tax?</h2>
<p>With this provider, the final withholding tax is not withheld. This means for the traders, that you make your entire capital including profits and earnings available in full for further investments. In the following year, it is then the taxpayer&#8217;s responsibility to declare the investment income from Interactive Brokers in the personal tax return.</p>
<p>The custody account management at Interactive Brokers llc is carried out in Great Britain. This brings with it a distinct advantage: you do not have to pay the final withholding tax until the end of the year in your tax return. You do not need an exemption order at Interactive Brokers.</p>
