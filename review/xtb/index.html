                        <h1>XTB Review</h1>

This online broker scores with a clear platform and a wide range of financial products, such as stocks and ETFs, which promise high returns when trading. Based on the XTB broker experience, XTB offers top service around the clock and the basic requirements for successful ETF and CFD trading. In this article we compile the main advantages, strengths and XTB experiences as well as the offers and services of X Trade Brokers.</p>

<p>Why should you trade through XTB Broker?</p>
<p>XTB works ceaselessly to improve its own trading platform and adapt it to the needs of traders. The highest level of security and protection of investors is provided by the largest regulatory bodies, which also controls and regulates X Trade Brokers. In recent years, the online broker has managed to become the award-winning trading platform that helps its clients trade on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The company was once founded in Warsaw and today it has managed to gain international influence. The XTB Depot is available to customers in Germany in German and shares its many years of experience with active traders and newcomers. Thus, it is possible to test yourself on the XTB portal with a free demo account and, starting from the first risk-free experiences, to use your own assets specifically in stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who or what is XTB?</p>
<p>XTB has an experience of over 15 years and is today the fourth largest CFD and Forex broker listed on the stock exchange. The company has offices in over 13 countries around the world, which include Germany, the UK, France and Chile. Its key strengths include its wide range of financial offerings and high-quality technology. These strengths at XTB are trusted by more than 220,000 customers. The employees do everything they can to make xStation one of the largest and most successful trading platforms. At the same time, XTB has developed a trading app that has the essential functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What trading instruments does XTB offer on the online platform?</p>
<p>XTB aims to specifically improve the trading experience of its customers. You have access to the global financial markets and can invest your money in the following financial products:</p>
<p>Currencies<br>
ETF savings plans<br>
Indices<br>
Commodities</p>
<p>With xStation, XTB has developed a platform that helps all clients manage Forex positions. Opening an account takes only a few minutes. You can trade CFD on 48 currency pairs with this provider. The most popular currency pairs include eur USD and GBP USD, as well as AUD USD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFD Trading: Trade CFDs with XTB Stocks</p>
<p>The CFDs are the Contracts for Difference or the contracts for difference. This refers to the agreement that has fallen between a trader and the XTB broker on the price developments in the underlying assets. CFDs are leveraged derivatives and maximum leverage of 30 to 1. Traders benefit from falling and rising prices when trading CFDs at XTB. Variable spreads and different asset classes offer traders a wide range of choice when trading CFDs.</p>
<p>CAUTION: The risk of losing money is not to be dismissed when trading with CFD. Start CFD trading with an XTB demo account and take advice in the live chat or by e-mail, so as not to make too high losses and learn about Forex trading.</p>
<p>Stock CFDs are also derivatives. This means that you do not own the underlying assets, but speculate on the fall and rise of prices via XTB broker. For example, if you buy 1,000 shares of Commerzbank and the current share price is 12.80 euros, the amount of the total investment via XTB would come to 12,800 euros. In addition, there are the commissions and the fees that are incurred individually for the respective transactions between the XTB broker and the stock exchange. In return, customers receive a share certificate. This is a legal document that confirms your ownership of the CFDs. Accordingly, you have a physical proof in your hands and take a tidy profit in the best case.</p>
<p>Potentially, CFD trading clients benefit from the same movements of the stock price &#8211; online you can manage and control your position at any time. Compared to traditional trading, you can make CFD transactions faster at XTB. However, you should keep in mind that the lucrative profits in trading can just as quickly turn into the opposite. The broker XTB from Frankfurt am Main recommends from therefore alone its users to first put virtual money with a demo account.</p>
<p>ETF CFDS trading on the trading platform XStation</p>
<p>Among the first decisions on the XTB trading platform is the amount of trading volume for the respective positions. At the broker XTB from Frankfurt am Main, there is a detailed report and guide on what you should consider when choosing bonds and the investment amount. Per account, you have a certain amount of initial assets with the demo account. This is digital money that you can not withdraw cash to your account. Based on the XTB test, these demo versions have proven to be extremely viable to test out the features and not put some of the assets at risk for this.</p>
<p>Trading assets depends on the risk aversion of shareholders and your own emotional well-being. This is how XTB combines wealth management with risk management. So you should understand how the trading volume can affect your future financial decisions. The volume that the client sets determines the coverage, which in technical language is called margin, as well as the value of the pip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XTB Experience: How to open a margin at XTB broker?</p>
<p>For a trade, you need a certain amount of security. This is called margin or cover in the trading language. This area is not part of the actual costs. The amount of money is frozen, so to speak, as soon as customers open a position. The XTB broker keeps the margin until the transaction is completed. Before that, it is necessary to determine how much the margin amount is when trading through XTB. This will help you determine the actual risk associated with trading. In addition, you can determine whether you have enough left from the remaining financial resources to open other positions through XTB.</p>
<p>This is particularly interesting in the case of CFDs, because these only take up a fraction of the nominal value. This then allows you to open multiple positions with a lower stake. The maximum leverage is allowed at this XTB broker at 1 to 30. This in turn equates to 3.33% of the nominal value as margin so that you can execute a transaction via XTB. The typical leverage in trading is 1 to 30 anyway, so it is possible for the customer to achieve a higher return on the capital invested. However, at the same time, the risk of losing the money completely increases. You should always be aware of these dangers. Anyone who has no or little experience with CFD trading should in no case start with the bonds in this area at XTB.</p>
<p>An example calculation for margin on XTB</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss the whole thing with a simple example and the most popular currency pair GBP USD with one lot and leverage set at 1:30. At this point, however, we do not know what the nominal value per lot is. You can find all the necessary information when trading directly on the broker for each financial instrument. Through this transparency and overview, XTB makes trading easier for its customers.</p>
<p>In this case, we arrive at a nominal value per lot, which is £100,000. If you now set the leverage at 1 to 30, you only need a margin of 3.33%. In this case, this would correspond to £3,333 if you want to complete a transaction with one lot. It is a basic principle in CFD trading that no trader or client should enter into a transaction with a margin that is greater than 30% in relation to their own capital. This is what years of experience have shown.</p>
<p>Take this formula also as a principle to avoid taking too high risks when trading CFDs through this provider. To be on the safe side, you should check where the maximum margin is when opening the transaction. Otherwise, you run the risk of not following the rules. If you keep to the extremely strict rules of risk management at this broker, you will also increase your chances of success in increasing returns and profits.</p>

<p>XTB Experience: What influence does the pip value have on XTB trading?</p>
<p>A second important factor in this area is the pip value. You should definitely know this value if you are in a safe risk management area . Thus, it is useful to know what the impact on your financial portfolio is if, for example, the market changes by 100 pips against you or in your favor.</p>
<p>Go to the itemized statement online on the broker&#8217;s website and read up. Then you can access the most important information about a financial instrument. If you want to calculate the pip value for a lot, take the nominal value per lot for this and multiply it by the size of a pip. You always specify the value in the respective currency, for example in US dollars or British pounds or euros. For example, if we have a nominal value of 100,000 and 0.001 pips, you multiply 100,000 and 0.001 to come to ten US dollars in the end.</p>
<p>So what does this mean as an example for trading on XTB? Let&#8217;s assume you open a transaction on the currency pair British pound and US dollar with one lot. The market changes by 100 pips in your favor. In this case, you make a profit of $1000 by multiplying $10 by 100 pips. With this simple calculation you can quickly determine where the maximum profits and losses are and in this context you can also set the stop loss. By setting this function, the depository will stop the position if it falls below a specified level range. This is to protect you from unforeseen losses.</p>
<p>XTB scores with enormous advantage in this area, such as with the privileged Pro model. Here, only 0.1 pips of fees are incurred per trade. You still have to calculate plus the other costs. You should have realized at this point that with knowledge of the individual technical terms and size values, you can much better assess when to invest which amount in which stocks and bonds. XTB helps its customers at every point with tutorials and guides as well as explanations. After all, the point is to specifically form your money and learn from the XTB experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Broker XTB program &#8211; Metatrader 4</p>

<p>How secure is XTB Broker?</p>
<p>On the portal there is an opportunity to participate in webinars to learn about xStation and the trading platform. Basically, the broker puts everything on the safety of its traders and wants to protect you from losing too much. Nevertheless, there is a huge risk associated with CFD and Forex trading. You lose money if you speculate or do not inform yourself sufficiently about the current market events.</p>
<p>For this reason, XTB uses additional security systems to improve protection on the trading platform. For the Basic account model, for example, XTB uses a guaranteed stop loss. In case of stronger market fluctuations, this guaranteed stop loss can ensure that an order was executed at a desired price. This excludes the possibility of slippage. Of course, a guaranteed stop loss does not cause unnecessary costs, it is only intended to increase safety.</p>
<p>In addition, an exclusion of the obligation to make additional margin is guaranteed. If the deposited capital of a trader is no longer sufficient to cover all his services, you do not have to inject additional capital. Your losses can never exceed the stake. BaFin issued this general ruling for CFDs in 2017, after which CFD brokers had three months to implement this obligation.</p>
<p>The XTB broker founded in 2002 and its headquarters in Warsaw. The broker is regulated by the German BaFin as well as the Polish Supervisory Authority for Security and Trade. So, the capital that you invest with this broker is secured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the State Securities Administration Office in Warsaw.

This is to protect their assets in the event of insolvency of XTB.</p>

Thus, one enjoys a high flexibility at the XTB online broker. Familiarization should not be a big problem even for beginners.

<p>The first trading experiences</p>
<p>Getting started trading with the XTB broker is unspectacular. Due to different strategies, one can trade successfully and use the bonus payment. Very gladly this bonus is applied to the binary options. However, one must never forget that this trading business is very risky. In order to be successful here, one should know the market sufficiently and observe it around the clock. For many investors CFD trading and trading in stocks CFDs have become a normality. This is no wonder. Many traders feel comfortable with the broker XTB. Whether they want to trade from 0.1 pips or Forex and CFDs. At XTB, these people will make fewer mistakes. Trading is explained very well to beginners at broker XTB. Therefore, they can make more money and keep the fees low.</p>
<p>The overview of the fees is very good and the transparency is high. The returns are appealing and the withdrawals can be made very quickly. While for most people trading stocks CFDs at XTB is a nice pastime, some people have already decided to earn a second income while trading on the XTB platform.</p>
<p>It can also be said that the returns are appealing. It is not for nothing that many people have withdrawals made. Admittedly, there are no fixed cycles for this. On the other hand, few traders consider their activities trading on XTB as the main income. It should not be like that in the first few months either.</p>
<p>A good tip is to lower your expectations. With a realistic attitude, you will experience fewer disappointments and continue to work on your goals without losing motivation. By the way, beginners and averagely experienced traders are happy if they earn enough money trading on XTB to buy a new washing machine or clothes. Expectations should not be higher in the beginning.</p>
<p>Are there any criticisms?</p>
<p>There is a lot of positive talk when trading on XTB. But what is the catch with CFD trading and trading in stock CFDs on XTB?</p>
<p>If there is something to criticize, then it is certainly the interest rate for the premium deposit. At the beginning it was already mentioned that this account plays a minor role for most investors. Interest is actually positive. However, only some people can benefit from the interest. As a normal user, one will not be able to take advantage of interest. Unfortunately, most investors find this a pity at XTB. With the bonus, it actually also works so that all customers get it. Apart from this shortcoming, XTB is an excellent broker. Another positive thing about XTB is the competent and friendly customer service.</p>
<p>The customer service can even be reached via live chat. This gives you a contact person and you can have your questions answered very quickly. In most cases, these are answered very directly and competently by the XTB employees. There is also a hotline. However, this is suitable for complex concerns.</p>

The Agena platform offers investors a wide range of functions for in-depth analysis of market events. There are available over 100 indicators, seven chart types as well as backtesting.</p>
<p>Opening an account &#8211; How to open a trading account</p>
<p>Opening a live account on Metatrader 4 or any other platform is quite simple. The important thing is to complete three steps, which are ideally completed within a short period of time. Thus, XTB offers a systematic process by which even beginners will have no problems to successfully complete their registration.</p>
<p>First, you have to go to the website of XTB. Thus, XTB offers a separate section on the homepage, where you have to decide on an account type. You can choose between a Basic, a Standard and a Pro account. The only differences are in the spreads.</p>
<p>The Basic account has a limited handle. One should also know at this point that the Forex broker provides this account for beginners. There is a table in the XTB test where you can see the limit. During the trading hours, one can guarantee from a stop loss. In this way, you cannot lose more than your invested money.</p>
<p>The standard account is a market maker account. It allows for unlimited trading. This account is suitable for advanced traders who have extensive market knowledge. However, variable spreads starting from 0.9 pips are possible. This option must be activated in advance in the settings.</p>
<p>XTB does not act as a market maker only with the Professional Account (Pro Account). The orders are forwarded here directly to the corresponding markets. However, this is associated with a commission. The fee will be worthwhile but only at the Forex broker if you have a large trading volume. Thus, this account is also suitable only for experienced traders. By the way, low spreads starting from 0.1 pips are also available with this account.</p>
<p>After registration, one has to confirm his identity. Normally, this process is done through a Postident procedure. Alternatively, one can carry out the identity verification at one&#8217;s house bank. If the verification is successful, the account will be activated.</p>
<p>Payment options</p>
<p>For the deposit the customer can use the following means:</p>
<p>Credit card<br>
PayPal<br>
KLARNA SOFORT<br>
bank transfer.</p>
<p>Very pleasant is the fact that it is possible to deposit with PayPal and Klarna Sofort. This can speed up the payment process. The use of PayPal and Klarna Sofort is also much easier than making a classic bank transfer. Not for nothing is XTB best CFD broker. This is the conclusion reached in a detailed XTB test.</p>
<p>If you want to use the bank transfer, you have to make the deposit to a reference account of the XTB broker. In doing so, one must specify the name of the account holder and the contract number.</p>
<p>Very pleasant is the news that one does not have to pay fees for any deposit method. At the same time, there is no minimum deposit amount. Lastly, one must make sure to provide correct information in the registration for a new account. The personal information or name must be identical to the name of the bank account. This is very important, because many beginners do not take the specification of their personal data so seriously. Problems arise for these people at the latest during the first withdrawal.</p>
<p>Customer service &#8211; professional and reliable</p>
<p>XTB can be reached around the clock within the working week. You can reach the friendly and competent staff by phone, live chat and email. The e-mail address can be found on the homepage of XTB. Support in German is available to the investor. This in particular stands out with the XTB broker. Experience shows that most traders take advantage of the telephone support at a broker. There is nothing wrong with that. However, it can help if you think about why you want to contact support in advance. Most of the time, the concerns are very simple, which makes contacting the live chat sufficient.</p>
<p>By the way, the XTB broker has set up a Training Academy. There are several training areas where you can learn more about the trading platform, mobile trading, social trading, maximum leverage, currencies like US dollars and other trading topics in German for free. The eLearning offer is very convincing. Here there are special course units, where you can get theoretical and practical knowledge. With the help of quizzes you can deepen your knowledge.</p>
<p>Customers should also take a look at the knowledge encyclopedia. Customers can learn more about the most important trading terms here. The live webinars round off the training program harmoniously. They take place at regular intervals for customers.</p>

<p>Mobile trading is just as important. More and more customers are trading on the move. More precisely, this means while waiting for public transport, at work, at home on the sofa or on vacation. The development of the mobile internet has made it much easier for many people to use apps on the go. Fortunately, the provider XTB is also one of the brokers that provide customers with a mobile app.</p>
<p>A look at XTB&#8217;s website showed that there is currently no mobile app. Customers therefore have to manage their account with XTB via a web app. But what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>A web app represents a website that is optimized for the use of mobile devices. More specifically, it means that when trading XTB you have to log into the XTB website. This is done on the go, of course. In most cases, you only have to do this login once. Then it is enough if you save the customer account as a bookmark.</p>
<p>After that, you can log in again and again automatically. A web app is a website that has been optimized for mobile use. This is also called &#8220;Responsive Design&#8221;. The problem is that the XTB website cannot be optimized for all mobile devices. While most users feel that they can trade EUR USD currency pairs on the go without any problems. However, some criticisms have already arisen that the font in the web app cannot be read on all mobile devices. Therefore, many traders wish that XTB will launch a mobile app in the foreseeable future. After all, then it will be much easier to invest and trade 10,000 euros on the go.</p>
<p>Conclusion XTB</p>
<p>In conclusion XTB can only be said that it is an excellent and professional platform. With a choice of 3 different platforms and different account types, every trader can pick his suitable platform for Forex trading. It must also be said that XTB has an excellent customer service. Traders can choose how they want to reach the support for questions about Forex and other things. The service staff can be reached around the clock within the week. One wishes that the customer service is easily accessible on weekends as well. However, this is not tragic since the service within the week has a very good accessibility.</p>
<p>The experience of XTB shows that many traders are very satisfied with XTB. This also speaks for the very high professional level at XTB. When trading, beginners can use the demo account to learn their first steps. Investors can invest US dollars to buy other trading currencies or currency pairs. Customers can still participate in the extensive education program to learn more about CFD and social trading. An excellent selection of educational videos on important topics such as CFD, Forex, cryptocurrencies and commodities enhances the trading experience and turns a beginner into a happy customer. In fact, it can be argued that XTB&#8217;s trading platform is built in such a way that even beginners will have no problems learning their way around their desired trading platform quickly. With the large and unique selection of platforms, this is not a big surprise.</p>
<p>A German-speaking customer service further ensures that German traders can convey all their concerns to the service staff. Overall, the trading experience at XTB is excellent and most customers describe their experience at XTB as top-notch.</p>
<p>The only thing that some customers do not like is the fact that the demo account is only valid for one month. One wishes here that the beginners and customers can use the free demo account for an unlimited time to be able to test trading with CFD for an unlimited time without risks. Especially when trading with CFD, the customers should first train the trade. Otherwise happens very quickly what happens with many other comparable online brokers: Customers do not get enough experience in dealing with CFD and lose their money within the first month.</p>
<p>Despite this minor criticism, most customers are very satisfied with XTB. Thus, happy customers share their positive experiences in online trading forums. These positive reviews once again confirm the high professional level of the XTB broker.</p>
<p>The experiences speak for themselves. Beginners should definitely try XTB. It is not for nothing that many XTB prospects become loyal customers.</p>
